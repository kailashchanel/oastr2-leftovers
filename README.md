Numerical simulations and observations show that galaxies are not uniformly distributed. In cosmology, the largest known structures in the universe are galaxy filaments formed from the hierarchical clustering of galaxies due to gravitational forces. These consist of “walls'' and “bridges'' that connect larger superclusters with higher densities. Here, a graph theoretic approach is taken to model these structures as temporal networks. Using a method borrowed from statistical physics called percolation, cosmological graphs are reduced based on the valency of nodes to reveal the inner, most robust structural formation in time. By constraining the network, we are able to identify a threshold for physical features such as reachability, density, and connectivity, at which galactic matter allows for the formation of galaxy filaments in clusters.
